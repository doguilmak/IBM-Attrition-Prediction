<h2>Description</h2>
<p>IBM is an American MNC operating in around 170 countries with major business verticals as computing, software, and hardware.

Attrition is a major risk to service-providing organizations where trained and experienced people are the assets of the company. The organization would like to identify the factors which influence the attrition of employees.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>This dataset has been referred from <a  href="https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/ibm-attrition-dataset">Kaggle</a>. </p>
<p>In this project, binary classification attrition target (class) was estimated with the model (artificial neural networks). We tried to predict attrition class (yes or no). All details are in <a href="https://github.com/doguilmak/IBM-Attrition-Prediction/blob/main/IBM_attrition.ipynb">IBM_attrition.ipynb</a> file.</p>

	<li>Build classification models to predict the anticipated attrition of employees.</li>
	<li>Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.</li>
</ul>
